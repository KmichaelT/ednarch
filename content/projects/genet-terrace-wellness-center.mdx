<TextBlock title="Overview">
Genet Terrace Wellness Center takes its name and its organizing principle from a single idea: that healing happens not just in treatment rooms but in the spaces between them — in gardens, in light, in the transition from inside to out.

The client, a wellness operator seeking to differentiate their facility, recognized that most wellness centers treat outdoor space as leftover. My design inverts this: the terraced landscape is the primary organizing element, with indoor spaces arranged around it.

The result is a facility where every treatment room opens to a private garden, where circulation offers choices between efficient routes and contemplative paths.

<TextBlock title="Terraced Program">
The site's gentle slope became the design generator. Rather than carve a flat pad, the building steps down with the land to form a series of planted terraces connected by gentle ramps and short stair runs. Active wellness functions — fitness, movement therapy, rehabilitation — cluster around the broadest terrace so classes can spill outdoors. Passive wellness rooms line a quieter wing, each treatment suite opening to its own planted courtyard. Shared amenities such as reception, changing rooms, and the café stitch the two zones together while keeping circulation legible.

<TextBlock title="Experience & Status">
Light, material, and movement reinforce the restorative agenda. Every room captures daylight through orientation, deep overhangs, and the shadow cast by adjacent terraces. Visitors can take the fast route from reception to therapy, or wander through gardens beside water features and shaded walkways. Smooth white render, natural stone, and warm timber keep the palette calm, while water and planting provide texture. The project currently stands as a planning study demonstrating how landscape-first thinking shapes both architecture and user experience, ready for visualization and detailed development once the client advances the commission.
