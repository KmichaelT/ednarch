<TextBlock title="Overview">
This residential commission for Eight-A Apartments captures the momentum of my latest built work. Over an intensive three-week sprint I led every phase — from the first charcoal sketches through Revit modeling, CAD documentation, and final Lumen renderings — to deliver a cohesive boutique living experience tailored to a single client. The goal was clarity: a modern, light-filled stack of homes that feel bespoke while staying efficient to construct.
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock title="Client Brief & Context">
Eight-A wanted a building that could transition young professionals into long-term residents. That meant expressive street presence, flexible floor plates, and amenities that feel generous despite a constrained urban lot. I used Revit early to lock structural grids, then iterated CAD details to coordinate the facade language — a composition of deep frames, shaded balconies, and inset glazing that balances privacy with openness.

<TextBlock title="Stacked Living Strategy">
Each floor plate contains two corner apartments that wrap a central service bar housing vertical circulation, baths, and storage risers. This consolidates utilities so living areas can remain column-free. Double-height voids at the ends of the bar borrow light from the facade, letting entry vestibules feel loft-like rather than compressed hallways.

<TextBlock title="Materiality & Light">
A restrained palette keeps the focus on volume: matte stucco frames, charcoal aluminum, and warm oak interiors. Lumen renders helped fine-tune daylight penetration, ensuring each unit gets morning and afternoon light despite the tight site. Balustrades are perforated metal, filtering views for privacy while glowing softly at night.

  items={[
    "Three-week concept-to-render workflow led solely by me",
    "Eight bespoke units organized around a compact core",
    "Generous balconies carved from the massing at every level",
    "Integrated millwork that doubles as acoustic buffering",
    "Revit + CAD coordination for efficient structural layout",
    "Lumen lighting studies that shape double-height volumes",
    "Amenity rooftop with planters tied into the facade frames",
    "Material palette balancing durability with softness"

<TextBlock title="Process & Delivery">
Working solo meant designing, documenting, and visualizing in parallel. Iterating between Revit and CAD let me freeze decisions quickly, while Lumen provided near-real-time lighting validation for every space. That tight loop meant the final deliverable arrived on schedule and gave the client confidence that the built result would mirror the renders — a complete, modern home for Eight-A’s community.
